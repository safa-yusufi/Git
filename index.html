    <h1>Git Tutorial</h1>
    <p>steps of working with git:</p>
   <ol> <li>first of all check the git version to see the version of your git in cmd or in your 
        terminal <strong>if you do not have git in your pc</strong>  install it.  </li>
        <li>now let git know who you are :Change the user name and e-mail address to your own.</li>
        <li>Now, let's create a new folder for your project</li>
     <li>Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder(Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.)</li>
    <li>You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.
So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. 
Then save or move it to the folder you just created.</li>
<li>Then,Check the status of the Git ()git status</li>
<li>Next,The file should be Staged.(git add .)</li>
<li>again chek the status, Now the file has been added to the Staging Environment</li>
<li>Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to commit for our repo</li>
<li>When we commit, we should always include a message.(The commit command performs a commit,
     and the -m "message" adds a message.)</li>
     <li>To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command.</li>
     <li>now you shoould create an account on Github,then sign in and Create a Repository on GitHub</li>
     <li>After creating a new repository,Since we have already set up a local Git repo, 
        we are going to push that to GitHub</li>
        <li>git remote add origin URL specifies that you are adding a remote repository, 
            with the specified URL, as an origin to your local Git repo.</li>
            <li>Now we are going to push our master branch to the origin url, and set it as the default remote branch.</li>

    </ol>
